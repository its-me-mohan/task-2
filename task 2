Document vs. Window Objects 

1.Document Object:

The document object represents the entire HTML document within a browser window. It serves as an interface to access and manipulate the content, structure, and styles of a web page.
// Change the title of the document
document.title = "New Title";
example;
// Get element by ID and change its content
document.getElementById("myElement").innerHTML = "Updated Content";


The document object represents the web page loaded in the browser.
It provides access to the elements within the HTML page.
Through the document object, we can dynamically manipulate the content of our web page.
You can access it using either window.document or simply document.

2.Window Object:
The window object represents the browser window or tab containing the DOM document. It acts as a global object, providing methods and properties related to the browser environment, including navigation, location, history, and timing.
example:
// Open a new window
window.open("https://www.example.com");

// Resize the current window
window.resizeTo(500, 500)
The window object represents the browser window itself.
It encompasses the entire browser viewport.
The window object contains properties and methods related to the browser window.
The document object is a property of the window object.
